# Problem 1 - Armstrong Numbers

An Armstrong number of N digits that is equal to the sum of the Nth powers of its digits. 

An example is all single digit numbers. Take 5 for example. 5 is a single digit and 5^1 is equal to 5, therefore it is an Armstrong number.

Another example is 371. 371 is three digits. 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 is 27 + 343 + 1, which added together is 371. Thus 371 is an Armstrong number.

Write a program to find all Armstrong numbers in the range of 0 and 999.
